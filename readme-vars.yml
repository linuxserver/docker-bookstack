  The default username is admin@admin.com with the password of **password**, access the container at http://dockerhost:6875.

  This application is dependent on a MySQL database be it one you already have or a new one. If you do not already have one, set up our MariaDB container here https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/mariadb/.

  
  If you intend to use this application behind a subfolder reverse proxy, such as our LetsEncrypt container or Traefik you will need to make sure that the `APP_URL` environment variable is set, or it will not work

  ### Advanced Users (full control over the .env file)
  If you wish to use the extra functionality of BookStack such as email, Memcache, LDAP and so on you will need to make your own .env file with guidance from the BookStack documentation.
    
  When you create the container, do not set any arguments for any SQL settings, or APP_URL. The container will copy an .env file to /config/www/.env on your host system for you to edit.	When you create the container, do not set any arguments for any SQL settings, or APP_URL. The container will copy an exemplary .env file to /config/www/.env on your host system for you to edit.
