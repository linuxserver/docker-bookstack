# PSA: Changes are happening

From August 2018 onwards, Linuxserver are in the midst of switching to a new CI platform which will enable us to build and release multiple architectures under a single repo. To this end, existing images for `arm64` and `armhf` builds are being deprecated. They are replaced by a manifest file in each container which automatically pulls the correct image for your architecture. You'll also be able to pull based on a specific architecture tag.

TLDR: Multi-arch support is changing from multiple repos to one repo per container image.

[Bookstack](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack) is a free and open source Wiki designed for creating beautiful documentation. Feautring a simple, but powerful WYSIWYG editor it allows for teams to create detailed and useful documentation with ease.

Powered by SQL and including a Markdown editor for those who prefer it, BookStack is geared towards making documentation more of a pleasure than a chore.

## Supported Architectures

Our images support multiple architectures such as `X86-64`, `arm64` and `armhf`. We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list). 

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Tag |
| :----: | --- |
| X86-64 | amd64-latest |
| arm64 | arm64v8-latest |
| armhf | arm32v6-latest |

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker

```
docker create \
  --name=bookstack \
  -e PUID=1001 \
  -e PGID=1001 \
  -e DB_HOST=<yourdbhost> \
  -e DB_USER=<yourdbuser> \
  -e DB_PASS=<yourdbpass> \
  -e DB_DATABASE=bookstackapp \
  -e APPURL=your.site.here.xyz \
  -p 6875:80 \
  -v <path to data>:/config \
  --restart unless-stopped
  linuxserver/bookstack
```


### docker-compose

Compatible with docker-compose v2 schemas.

```
---
version: "2"
services:
  bookstack:
    image: linuxserver/bookstack
    container_name: bookstack
    environment:
      - PUID=1001
      - PGID=1001
      - DB_HOST=<yourdbhost>
      - DB_USER=<yourdbuser>
      - DB_PASS=<yourdbpass>
      - DB_DATABASE=bookstackapp
      - APPURL=your.site.here.xyz
    volumes:
      - <path to data>:/config
    ports:
      - 6875:80
    mem_limit: 4096m
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 80` | will map the container's port 80 to port 6875 on the host |
| `-e PUID=1001` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1001` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e DB_HOST=<yourdbhost>` | for specifying the database host |
| `-e DB_USER=<yourdbuser>` | for specifying the database user |
| `-e DB_PASS=<yourdbpass>` | for specifying the database password |
| `-e DB_DATABASE=bookstackapp` | for specifying the database to be used |
| `-e APPURL=your.site.here.xyz` | for specifying the url your application will be accessed on  |
| `-v /config` | this will store any uploaded data on the docker host |

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id username
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Application Setup

This application is dependent on an SQL database be it one you already have or a new one. If you do not already have one, set up our MariaDB container.

Once the MariaDB container is deployed, you can enter the following commands into the shell of the MariaDB container to create the user, password and database that the app will then use. Replace myuser/mypassword with your own data.

**Note** this will allow any user with these credentials to connect to the server, it is not limited to localhost

```
from shell: mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE bookstackapp;
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'myuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
GRANT ALL privileges ON 'bookstackapp'.* TO 'myuser'@localhost;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Once you have completed these, you can then use the docker run command to create your BookStack container. Make sure you replace things such as <yourdbuser> with the correct data.

Then docker start bookstackapp to start the container. You should then be able to access the container at http://dockerhost:6875

Default username is admin@admin.com with password of **password**

If you intend to use this application behind a reverse proxy, such as our LetsEncrypt container or Traefik you will need to make sure that the `APPURL` environment variable is set, or it will not work

Documentation can be found at https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/

### Advanced Users
If you wish to use the extra functionality of BookStack such as email, memcache, ldap and so on you will need to make your own .env file with guidance from the BookStack documentation.

When you create the container, do not set any arguements for SQL or APPURL. The container will copy an .env file to /config/www/.env on your host system for you to edit. 

### Composer

Some simple docker-compose files are included for you to get started with. You will still need to manually configure the SQL server, but the compose files will get the stack running for you.
